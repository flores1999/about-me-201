    <p>About Jeffery Flores</p>

    <P>Today I will be talking about a few things about myself, in hope to help you get to know me better. I will talk a bit about my education, my work history, and some of my goals. As of today I am going to a bootcamp for software development at code fellows in hopes to get my certification. Outside of that I have my diploma, one year of college, and Army training. When it comes to my work history it is nothing special. I mainly come from a constitution and an Army background.  For constitution I did a lot of different things from building houses, decks, pools, and even installing solar panels. On the Army side of things I am still in but on the reserve side. I have been in for five years now and would like to get at least ten years in.My job within the is 11B (infantry). I have done a lot within the Army from going to three different countries and doing joint operations to being in the honor gourd. My goals I have in mind and that I am working towards everyday are getting my degree in computer science from OSU, staying in the best shape possible, and becoming financially independent. I hope this helps you get to know me a bit better.       
    </P>
